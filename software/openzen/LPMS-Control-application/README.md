# OpenMAT (LPMS-Control, LpSensor)
The LPMS-Control application allows users to control various aspects of an LPMS device from a PC [ref](https://lp-research.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LKB/pages/1100677224/LPMS-Control+Software).

The application has the following core functionality:
* List all LPMS devices connected to the system
* Connect to up to 256 sensors simultaneously
* Adjust all sensor parameters (sensor range etc.).
* Set orientation offsets
* Initiate accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer calibration.
* Display the acquired data in real-time either as line graphs or a 3D image
* Record data from the sensors to a CSV data file
* Play back data from a previously recorded CSV file
* Upload new firmware and in-application-programming software to the sensor

LPMS-Control can be downloaded directly from the LP-Research website support page.
