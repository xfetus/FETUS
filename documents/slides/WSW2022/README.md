# Westminster STEAM week (15th March 2022)

Delighted to be invited to present FETUS workshop at Westminster STEAM week (Monday 14 th â€“ Friday 18 th March 2022). That said, I am opening this ticket to prepare the delivery of the workshop for the Tuesday 15th March 2022. It is important to note that the audience is in the age group: Year 9 or 10 and the school mentions that the gender is 92% Girls, 8% Boys on roll. For the event, we are expecting 30 students.
