   abstract = {Work-related musculoskeletal disorders constitutes a substantial burden for society, generating individual suffering and financial costs. Quantifying the musculoskeletal stress and establishing exposure-response relationships is an important step in facing this problem. Observational methods for assessing exposure in the field of ergonomics have shown poor results, and the technical measurement methods that exists are often complicated to use which limits their scope to scientific purposes. This work describes the development of a prototype measurement system aimed to simplify ambulatory measurements of musculoskeletal load, specifically aimed at the wrist and hand. Wearable sensors including Inertial Measurement Units (IMU:s) and Electromyography (EMG) were connected to a smartphone and used for measuring wrist movement and forearm muscle activity. Data sampled in the smartphone was stored online in a cloud database, and a webapplication was developed to visualize work-load exposure. Testing under controlled conditions indicated that muscular rest can be measured and classified according to suggested risk thresholds. Accurate angular measurements were difficult to implement because of lacking inter-sensor alignment in the horizontal plane, as well as uncertainties in the Bluetooth protocol. Future work should focus on the IMU:s and look to further develop a method of correcting the relative angle error, as well as investigating accurate time synchronization of the two sensors.Alternatively, deriving angular velocities directly from the IMU gyroscopes could be investigated. },
