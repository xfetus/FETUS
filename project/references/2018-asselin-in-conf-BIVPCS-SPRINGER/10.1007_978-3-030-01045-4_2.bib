abstract="PURPOSE: This paper describes an open-source ultrasound-guided central line insertion training system. Modern clinical guidelines are increasingly recommending ultrasound guidance for this procedure due to the decrease in morbidity it provides. However, there are no adequate low-cost systems for helping new clinicians train their inter-hand coordination for this demanding procedure. METHODS: This paper details a training platform which can be recreated with any standard ultrasound machine using inexpensive components. We describe the hardware, software, and calibration procedures with the intention that a reader can recreate this system themselves. RESULTS: The reproducibility and accuracy of the ultrasound calibration for this system was examined. We found that across the ultrasound image the calibration error was less than 2 mm. In a small feasibility study, two participants performed 5 needle insertions each with an average of slightly above 2 mm error. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the accuracy of the system is sufficient for clinician training.",
